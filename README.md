QuantMethods-MATLAB

This repository collects short, classroom-ready MATLAB examples for teaching and exploring computational methods in finance and data science.
Each example includes a runnable Live Script (.mlx) and a static PDF version (non-interactive) for easy reference and distribution.

Instructions
Each topic is contained in its own folder and can be opened directly in MATLAB.
To explore the material interactively, open the corresponding Live Script (.mlx) file.
If you prefer a non-interactive view, a static PDF version of each Live Script is also provided.
The instructions inside the Live Script guide you through the activities and exercises. It is recommended to run each section individually to observe intermediate results. Interactive controls (such as sliders, checkboxes, buttons, etc.) allow you to experiment with different parameters and datasets, encouraging exploration and hands-on learning.
